# Budget Calculator / Expense Divider
The following project called “Budget Calculator / Expense Divider” is designed to make life easier for all people who have to share expenses, whether with family, roommates or friends, and also for people who have problems managing their budgets or finances. They can track expenses or simply balance them equally. As a foreigner living with roommates, I am experiencing how difficult it can be to balance or divide expenses equally and keep track in case someone owes money to another. So I think it's very interesting that you can solve a problem that I'm sure many other people have, including me. It is well known that relationships and money are not topics that can be mixed. But studies show that splitting expenses strengthens relationships and establishes equality. This project consists of a shared list of transactions that allows expenses to be balanced, each person enters their expenses and the balance of each participant is calculated.
